# Simple To Do Checklist Project

A simple to-do checklist project made from Java for CPSC210.

## Proposal

- *What will the application do?*
    - Keep track of tasks through entering them manually into individual text boxes. Check off items that are finished
      and keep a history of them. Able to edit tasks by clicking on the task to make changes. Delete tasks and sort them
      differently by alphabetical, date, etc.
- *Who will use it?*
    - Anyone could use it, this application is not only tailored to students but anyone who needs to keep track of
      something. For example, you can keep track of groceries to purchase, important meeting dates, and daily routines.
- *Why is this project of interest to you?*
    - This is the first coding project I will have ever done while learning Java. This project interests me because of
      its simplicity and functionality. I've been using notepad to keep track of tasks I have to do. While notepad is
      great for keeping track of small amount of tasks, a large amount of homework, labs, and things to do easily gets
      really cluttered. Hopefully, this project will eliminate that.
